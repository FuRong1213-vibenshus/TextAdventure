# TextAdventure

This repo is used to store all the projects that implementing the game Text Adventure, in a way so called "stepvis improvement"". 
We start by analysing a simple game written in structure of imperitive / functional programming

https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmeringsparadigme

In the following 4-5 weekes, we are going to focus on re-writting the game while adding the following new features and concepts

> Flow chart and UML for object oriented programming

> Design Principles and Design Patterns

> Classes inheritance

> State Machine

## Introduction

The game "text adventure" is a type of IF (Interactive Fiction), here is one example:

## Chart Drawing

> ### **Flow chart**
>> *Do it yourself*: Draw a flow chart for the game "text adventure" in the folder Step1.
>> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart#Common_symbols

> ### **Class diagram**
>> *Do it yourself*: read through the UML tutuorial https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/uml-class-diagram-tutorial/ and try answer the following questions:
>> - What is UML class diagram ? What can UML class diagram visualize ?
>> - What are the three main components in the UML Class notation
>> - This tutorial https://www.gleek.io/blog/class-diagram-arrows.html introduced several relations between classes. In our project, we are going to use the following ones. Make sure that you understand the meaning of these relations
>>>- Inheritance
>>>- Association
>>>- Aggregation
>>>- Composition
>> - Analyse the "class diagram for an ATM system" in this article, https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-class-diagram. Describe the relations between the classes **Bank**, **Customer**, **ATM**, **Account**, **ATM transactions**, **Current Account** and **Saving Account**

## Some improvement ideas ?



## Home Work
> - Change the codes of text adventure in Step1 into object oriented. You can follow the steps:
>> 1. Make a list of all the involved objects in the game. 
>> 2. Add the attributes and operations (methods) to each object (class) 
>> 3. Draw the UML class diagram. 
>> 4. Implement according to the UML
> - Make a sketch (in words or drawing or both) of your own text adventure game. It must include at least four scenes, two characters, some inventories to collect and a win condition.

> In both homework parts, you can choose to work on your own fiction or just simply extend the given one in Step1.
